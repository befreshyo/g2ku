   <h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
   <p>
        I am a senior, with a major in computer science. 
        I love computers and technology, this degree fascinates and 
        intrigues me to keep wanting to learn more about it. I enjoy 
        coding and want to continue to improve that skill. In this course,
        I wish to be able to understand software engineering and how 
        to implement software systems in methods, strategies, and tools. 
        I spend a lot of my free time with my family and I have an older brother,
        a dog named Francis, and a cat named Kitten. 
    </p>

   <h4><u>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</u></h4>
   <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>To understand software engineering</li>
    <li>How to implement software systems in methods, strategies, and tools</li>
    <li>To use systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software</li>
   </ul> 
   <br>
   <h4><u>My Favorite Hobby</u></h4>
   <p>
        My hobbies include spending a lot of time on the computer,
        either playing video games, searching the web, or just chatting with
        my friends. I enjoy reading and researching to learn new information. 
        I enjoy spending any free time I have outdoors.

   <h4><u>Fun Fact</u></h4>
   <p>
        I was always fascinated on how a computer worked internally
        and externally. As I have always loved playing video games, one day
        I decided I would learn how to build my own computer. I thought it
        would be interesting to learn how each component worked together inside the computer,
        so I learned first-hand on how it works.
